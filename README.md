1. Project Title
Friendship Badges – A Clarity Smart Contract for Celebrating Connections

2. Project Description
The Friendship Badges smart contract allows users to award digital badges to friends on the Stacks blockchain.
Each badge is unique to the giver–receiver pair and acts as a public proof of friendship.
The contract includes:

give-badge: Award a badge to a friend.

has-badge: Check if a badge exists between two people.

3. Project Vision
To create a decentralized, immutable, and fun way to celebrate relationships, milestones, and trust on the blockchain — where friendships can be commemorated without intermediaries.

4. Future Scope
Badge Metadata: Add badge designs, colors, and custom messages.

Revocation System: Allow badge removal if friendship changes.

Event Notifications: Trigger events when badges are given.

Leaderboards: Showcase users with the most badges.

NFT Integration: Convert badges into transferable NFTs.
